\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

LSST will discover large numbers of astrophysical objects that move, change, or appear.
Because of their intrinsic temporal variability, full scientific exploitation of many classes of these events requires rapid discovery and additional follow-up observations.
Accordingly, LSST's real-time Prompt Processing pipelines will identify such detections using difference imaging and report them using world-public \textit{alerts} issued within 60 seconds of the shutter closure.

These alert packets will contain not only the information about the most recent detection but also a historical lightcurve, cutout images, timeseries features, and other contextual information.
An LSST science user will be able to use the contents of a single alert packet and make an rapid but informed decision about whether the event is relevant to their scientific goals.
LSST expects to produce about ten million of these alerts nightly.
The resulting \textit{alert stream} will be large---more than 1\,TB nightly---but will contain all classes of astrophysical events, from the youngest supernovae to the most distant RR Lyrae to the slowest-moving Trans-Neptunian Objects.
The task for the scientist is to identify the small subset of events of interest in the larger alert stream.

To do so, astronomers will rely on third party \textit{community brokers}, software systems that receive the full LSST alert stream and add additional information to it.
Community brokers may crossmatch the LSST stream to multiwavelength catalogs, join LSST alerts with those from other surveys, provide machine-learned classifications of events, and/or offer user filters to winnow the stream.
LSST will itself offer a simple filtering service, the ``mini-broker,'' that will apply user-supplied filters to the alert stream.
Individual scientists will receive alerts through one or more of these services.

The large volume of the alert stream and the finite bandwidth from the LSST Data Facility necessitates a proposal process to select community brokers to receive the full stream.
This document outlines the process, criteria, and timeline by which LSST will choose community brokers.
To provide context, we also summarize the major features of the LSST Alert Production systems as well as relevant data rights concerns.

Throughout the document, we provide references to the formal LSST requirements and design documents as an aid to the interested reader.
